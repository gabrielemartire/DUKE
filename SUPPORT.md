i would like to improve some fancy functionality, like: 
- use the full potential of pdf.js
- Improve keyword block management, giving the possibility of KW cleaning, eliminating duplicates and setting a custom separator.
- Implement AI features that allow you to:
- Check whether the paragraph containing the keyword found is contextual to a previously indicated topic (in a further text box).
- Autogenerate a block of keywords starting from a context.
- Search for a set of keywords on multiple PDFs at once.
- Improve the PDF navigation toolbox.
